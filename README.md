# Weather-Data-Science-Project

This project tries to predict weather using machine learning. The dataset contains 62 years worth of data from Oakland International Airport. The data is read into a Pandas Data Frame and undergoes various transformations in preparation for the machine learning component. The Ridge Regression model is used as the model is trained on data before 2021 and is tested on data after 2021.This project uses python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
